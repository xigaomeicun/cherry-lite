# Browser Use — Gap Analysis & Design

Where `@cherry/browser` (the built-in browser MCP server) stands against real
"browser use", what Chromium/Electron provide, what the open-source field and
OpenAI's Codex desktop converged on, and the roadmap to close the gap.
Research date 2026-09-08; source clones under `/tmp/bu-research/` (browser-use,
playwright monorepo, chrome-devtools-mcp, stagehand, nanobrowser, UI-TARS-desktop,
midscene, agent-browser, mcp-chrome, Chromium `chrome/browser/actor`, ChatGPT.app bundle).

Implementation detail (files, APIs, commit split, test plan) for P0/P1 and the existing Agent browser integration is in
[`browser-use-implementation.md`](./browser-use-implementation.md).

Current runtime baseline: Electron 44.2.0 / Chromium 152.0.7977.76, inherited from `main`.
The Electron 41 observations below are historical test evidence. Native WebMCP is implemented
in C3 on this baseline; retained-tab freezing and WebContentsView migration remain deferred.

## Delivery status

PR1 (PR A), [#20128](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/pull/20128), implements the
shared CDP engine and annotation export migration on `browser-use-engine`; it is open, not merged.
The engine provides document-bound refs, bounded AX/DOM snapshots and diffs, dialog interruption,
and managed/borrowed ownership with resource budgets.

PR2 (PR B), [#20134](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/pull/20134), is implemented on
`browser-use-mcp`, based on `browser-use-engine`: the MCP adapter now
lives in the browser feature, its tabs use the shared service, and snapshot/action tools are exposed.
`upload_file` remains deferred until MCP calls carry a trusted session working directory. Turn-scoped
retention likewise requires upstream session identity and a turn-ended signal. See the implementation
plan for the remaining PR C/D boundaries.

PR3 (C1–C2), [#20139](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/pull/20139), is open on
`browser-use-inspection`, based on PR2: same-document
ref recovery, `find`, `console_messages` and `network_requests`. WebMCP is delivered by the separate C3 layer below.

C3, [#20582](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/pull/20582), implements native
`list_web_tools` / `call_web_tool` on `browser-use-webmcp`, based on `browser-use-cursor`.
It covers main-document imperative tools in managed and Agent-bound guests. See
[WebMCP integration boundary](#webmcp-integration-boundary) for runtime support and deferred capabilities.

### Historical delivery plan — connect the existing Agent browser

The following records the initial Agent integration scope, before the inherited Electron 44 upgrade
and the C3 WebMCP implementation.

The Agent right pane already has `AgentBrowserRightPanel` → `WebviewBrowser` → `WebviewHost`,
with navigation, search and annotations. The `agent-browser-integration` stack layer extends this surface; it does not
create another browser UI. It builds on PR3 and combines visible-page control, ordinary website
browsing, persistent browser data, history/import settings and a bundled `cherry-browser` skill.
Implementation is on `agent-browser-integration`, based on PR3, in
[#20166](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/pull/20166).
Ordinary HTTP(S) browsing explicitly permits LAN and loopback access; this initial plan used Electron 41.8.0.

The gaps at that planning stage were:

- MCP actions target the controller's separate `BrowserView` guests, not the right-pane guest.
- The right pane's `AgentDevPreview` policy permits an authorized loopback origin; HTML artifacts
  have a separate file policy. Ordinary website browsing needs its own security profile.
- The pane uses an in-memory partition, while standalone MCP normal tabs use `persist:default`.
  Importing into the latter alone would not sign the user into the visible page.
- Back/forward navigation exists; persistent searchable visit history and external-data import do not.
- A bundled skill can teach the workflow, but cannot grant browser access or mount tools by itself.

The integration will bind the existing guest to its trusted Agent Session in main, so user actions,
annotations and model actions address the same document. Page ownership stays with the UI; MCP
disconnect or idle eviction must not close it. Ordinary browsing gets a dedicated persistent profile
shared across ordinary Agent browser pages, while page control remains session-scoped. Local previews
and HTML artifacts keep their isolation. Existing standalone MCP storage is not silently copied.

History includes visits made by either the user or Agent and supports search, reopen, delete and clear.
Imports include history and login data (cookies; localStorage from storage-state files), selected by
the user in Browser settings. Profile readers report support per data category; file import remains
available when login-data decryption is unsupported. Password stores, extensions and browser settings
are excluded; bookmark import needs a bookmark consumer and remains a follow-up.

Cookie decryption is scoped to each user-started import: macOS Keychain, Windows current-user DPAPI
and Linux Secret Service/KWallet. Windows app-bound (`v20`) cookies remain unsupported and require
login in the pane. Report expired, partitioned, unsupported, inaccessible-key and decryption-failure
counts separately. System helpers and key buffers end with the tracked import operation; discovery
never reads keys. See [delivered support](./browser-use-implementation.md#127-delivered-import-support-and-validation)
for supported formats, Linux prerequisites and OS validation limits.

The initial integration kept Electron at 41.8.0 and excluded WebMCP; the current baseline and C3 delivery are listed above.
Multiple visible tabs, retained-tab freezing, a full handoff protocol and
`WebContentsView` migration are not prerequisites for this PR. The file-level plan, tool compatibility
boundary and acceptance cases are in [implementation §12](./browser-use-implementation.md#12-existing-agent-browser-integration).

## PR3 baseline — `src/main/features/browser/mcp/`

This table records the inspection layer before Agent integration and C3, not the current tool surface.

| Dimension | PR3 behavior |
|---|---|
| Tool surface | 21 tools: PR2's 18 tools plus find, console_messages and network_requests |
| Page representation | Main-process AX + DOM snapshot with actionable `eN` refs, diff output by default, scope by ref and 40,000-character cap |
| Actions | Real mouse/key input and verified typing; native select events; reported synthetic fallback for covered left single clicks |
| CDP | Shared `GuestSession` ownership, command allow-list, cancellation and deadlines |
| Host | Hidden `BrowserWindow` + `BrowserView` tabs; `persist:default` / `private` partitions; BrowserView replacement is PR C |
| Robustness | Navigation/network settling, dialog interruption/watchdog, download updates, popup IDs, explicit tab targeting, global budgets; one recovery before an action for uniquely named same-document replacements |
| Inspection | Exact AX role/name search; per-managed-guest console/exception and network summaries, each bounded to 200 entries |
| Still pending | Upload authorization, OOPIF, WebMCP tools, retained-tab freezing, visible-pane control and coordinate actions |

## What "browser use" converged on (9 projects read from source)

| Consensus | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Raw CDP is the end state** | browser-use and Stagehand v4 both dropped Playwright for raw CDP; agent-browser is raw CDP in Rust; Midscene's extension mode is raw CDP via `chrome.debugger`. Electron's `webContents.debugger` is exactly this transport |
| **Stable addressing = `backendNodeId`** | browser-use uses it directly as the index; chrome-devtools-mcp memoises `loaderId_backendNodeId`; agent-browser resolves `@eN → {backendNodeId, role, name, nth, frameId}` and re-queries the AX tree by role+name+nth when the id goes stale (`element.rs:342-360`) |
| **Real input events separate mature from immature** | browser-use / Stagehand / agent-browser: `DOM.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded → getContentQuads → Input.dispatchMouseEvent` with an occlusion hit-test and JS fallback; UI-TARS and mcp-chrome still `element.click()` — same tier as us |
| **Dialogs are routinely missed** | UI-TARS and Midscene have no dialog handling at all; playwright-mcp's `### Modal state` section + racing actions against modal state, and browser-use's watchdogs, are the templates |
| **Vision converges on 0–1000 normalised coordinates** | DPR/scale mapping is the recurring bug source; Midscene models it explicitly (`shrunkShotToLogicalRatio`). Midscene v1.12 went vision-only while Stagehand v4 deleted CUA — "AX/DOM tree first, vision optional" remains the stable combination |
| **Nobody drives an Electron `webContents`** | UI-TARS-desktop and Midscene studio (both Electron) launch an external system Chrome via puppeteer-core. Driving our own visible `WebviewBrowser` pane is a genuine differentiator: user-visible, annotatable, takeover-able, no external Chrome dependency |
| **Cost controls** | browser-use: viewport ±1000 px filter, 40 k-char cap, paint-order occlusion, `*` marks new elements; playwright-mcp: `browser_find`; Codex: AX **diff** output by default |

## What Chromium / Electron provide

Everything needed is CDP, reachable through `webContents.debugger.sendCommand(method, params, sessionId?)`
(Electron 41.8 = Chromium 146; `sessionId` support means OOPIF child sessions work):
`Accessibility.getFullAXTree`, `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` (computed styles / paintOrder / DOMRects),
`DOM.*` (`getContentQuads`, `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`, `setFileInputFiles`, `resolveNode`), `Input.*`,
`Page.handleJavaScriptDialog` / `setInterceptFileChooserDialog` / `setDownloadBehavior` / `startScreencast`,
`Target.setAutoAttach{flatten}`, `Network` / `Fetch`, `Emulation`, `Overlay.highlightNode`, `DOMDebugger.getEventListeners`,
`Autofill.trigger`. Electron adds `WebContentsView`, `WebFrameMain.executeJavaScript`, `will-download`,
permission handlers.

Not available to us: Chromium's built-in **Actor** framework (`chrome/browser/actor/`, the
Gemini-in-Chrome agent — `chrome/` layer, Glic-only, no extension API) and its
**AnnotatedPageContent** page representation (Blink code is present but has no CDP exposure);
Chrome extension APIs (`chrome.debugger`). The historical Electron 41.8.0 / Chromium 146.0.7680.216
instance's `/json/protocol` did not advertise **`WebMCP`** (checked 2026-09-07).
The experimental [CDP WebMCP domain](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/WebMCP/)
exists in tip-of-tree and our protocol types; neither guarantees runtime availability or a particular
Electron release. Actor is still the best reference design: `PageTarget = variant<Point, DomNode{id, document token}>`,
three-stage validation (validate → time-of-use against the last observation → invoke, with a
renderer-side hit-test that must land inside the target), per-tool `ActionResultCode` ranges, a
page-settled observation state machine, and a handoff-button UI.

## OpenAI Codex desktop (ChatGPT.app 26.825) — same architecture, one generation ahead

ChatGPT.app is Electron. Its in-app browser (`iab`) is a renderer `<webview>`; the main process
attaches `webContents.debugger('1.3')` and relays CDP over a native pipe to an out-of-process
Node runtime (`cua_node` + `@oai/browser-desktop`). That is structurally our `WebviewBrowser` +
`AnnotationSession`. Design points worth adopting:

- **Code mode**: one MCP tool (`node_repl.js`) plus a typed JS API — `tab.ax.write()` /
  `tab.ax.click(index)` / `setValue` / `pressKey` / `scroll` / `selectText` /
  `performSecondaryAction`, with a documented priority `ax > playwright > dom_cua > cua`;
  the model pulls docs on demand via `browser.documentation()`.
- **AX text + element index + revision diff** as the primary representation (a Rust→WASM
  "revision" engine; the same engine drives macOS native apps in `@oai/sky`).
- **WebMCP via preload polyfill** (`document.modelContext` shim relayed to main) — observed in this
  Codex bundle; this is an implementation reference, not evidence of native Electron support or
  conformance to the current WebMCP draft.
- **CDP allow-list**: `Target.*` blocked except `setAutoAttach`, `Page.navigate` intercepted for
  origin policy, `Fetch.enable` limited to non-Document patterns, `DOM.setFileInputFiles` blocked in
  favour of the file-chooser flow; per-origin `{access, downloads, uploads, full_cdp_access}` config.
- **Governance**: three-tier confirmation policy (hand-off required / confirm at action time /
  transmission boundary for sensitive data), untrusted-content rule, `browserAuth` credential
  isolation (model never sees secrets), fail-closed user-tab claiming (title+url snapshot),
  management audit trail, background-by-default visibility.

## Relationship to the existing annotation feature

The WebView annotation stack (PRs #17842 / #17872) is not a sibling of browser use — it is the
first half of the same engine. Both sides observe and address elements in a guest page through
the same three seams; browser use adds the *act* half.

**Shared infrastructure already in place**

| Seam | Annotations today | What browser use reuses |
|---|---|---|
| Guest preload (`src/preload/webview.ts`, `WebviewAnnotationController.ts`) | Selection overlay (hover / click / marquee), pins, `selection_pending` → host editor, key replay to the host, session-scoped bridge protocol | Same injection point and bridge for highlight-on-action, "which element did the agent touch" pins, and future human handoff UI; WebMCP uses the capability-selected adapter described below |
| Element locator (`WebviewElementLocator`) | `selector` (unique CSS through open shadow roots), `tagName`, `text`, `ariaLabel`, `role`, `styles`, optional `region { rect, elements[] }` | Becomes the human-authored **target**: an annotation is a `PageTarget` the agent can act on without re-discovering it. `styles` (position / z-index / offsets) is exactly the context an agent needs for layout fixes |
| Main-side AX capture (`services/webview/annotationExport.ts`) | Acquires a borrowed `GuestSession` and calls `describeElement(annotation, budget, options)`; release detaches only after the last owner leaves | Shares debugger ownership and command cancellation with whole-page AX/DOM snapshots; annotation path/subtree formatting stays intact |
| Host surface (`WebviewBrowser`, `AgentBrowserRightPanel`) | Composer-kernel editor popover, `onAnnotationSaved` → `webviewAnnotation` composer token (`formatAgentWebviewAnnotationPrompt`) | The pane the agent drives is the pane the user annotates; the token is the human → agent hand-off, browser use is the agent → page hand-off |
| Export / read tool (`webview.export_annotations`, `read_webview_annotations`) | Markdown with the untrusted-data notice, AX path/subtree, region element list | Same formatter vocabulary and the same trust boundary for snapshot output |

**One hard constraint: a single debugger session per guest**

PR1 moves annotation capture into `features/browser/snapshot/describeElement.ts` and makes
`GuestSession` own the attach/detach lifecycle for both capture paths. Multiple consumers of the
same borrowed guest share one debugger; releasing an annotation export cannot detach another
consumer's session. DevTools or an externally attached debugger still produces `debugger_unavailable`.
PR2 migrates the legacy MCP controller onto these shared snapshots and actions.

**Two addressing schemes to reconcile**

Annotations address elements by CSS selector (stable across page reloads, human-readable, resolvable
in the guest); browser use addresses by `backendNodeId` (stable within a document lifetime, what CDP
input and AX APIs take). Keep both, map between them at the boundary: a locator gains an optional
`backendNodeId` (valid for the current document identifier, cf. Chromium Actor's
`DomNode{node_id, document_identifier}`), and the snapshot engine resolves a selector → node id
on demand. These locator additions belong to P3; PR1 preserves the saved annotation schema and resolves
selectors through the existing isolated-world capture. Region annotations would map to
`{ ancestor backendNodeId, contained backendNodeIds[] }` the same way.

**What each side gains**

- Annotations → browser use: a precise, user-vetted target and intent ("make these two overlapping
  cards not overlap") with layout styles attached — the agent starts from a `click(ref)`-quality
  reference instead of a page-wide search, and the composer token already carries it into the run.
- Browser use → annotations: the agent can *act* and then *verify* on the same pane (re-snapshot, diff,
  screenshot); pins double as the "what the agent touched" trail; the handoff protocol (pause → user
  annotates or acts → resume) is the human-in-the-loop UI annotations already half-built.
- Both: one session registry, shared CDP command handling and the same untrusted-data boundary;
  full-page snapshots and annotation path/subtree exports keep their respective formatters.

**Ordering consequence for the roadmap**

PR1 completed the shared engine and annotation migration. PR2 now uses `GuestSession` for
the MCP controller as well, removing its independent debugger attach path.

## Browser session management (performance)

Session management is needed, but as **ownership + retention rules + a resource budget**, not
as heavy infrastructure. Idle tabs are the smaller cost; snapshot capture is the larger one.

**Problems addressed by PR1/PR2**

- `CdpBrowserController` is instantiated **per MCP connection** (`server.ts:10`, disposed on
  disconnect); `maxWindows = 5` and `idleTimeoutMs = 5 min` are per controller. Two agent sessions
  = two hidden-window sets, no global budget.
- Reclamation is **lazy**: `sweepIdle` only runs on the next window create/access. After a task ends,
  hidden `BrowserView`s (one renderer process each, tens to hundreds of MB) and their attached
  debuggers survive until someone touches the browser again.
- No ownership/retention semantics: agent scratch tabs, pages the user should see, and pages needed
  next turn all share one `lastActive`.

**What the field does**

- Codex desktop: a main-process `BrowserSessionRegistry` routes backends per conversation
  (`ensureBackendForSession` / `disposeBackendForSession` / `disposeAfterSessionActivity`);
  agent-created tabs **close when the turn ends** unless explicitly `tab.markDeliverable()` (user-facing
  output) or `tab.markHandoff()` (continue next turn); marks are turn-scoped, latest wins; claimed user
  tabs are released by default; "prefer claiming an existing tab over opening a duplicate".
- browser-use keeps exactly one `about:blank` (AboutBlankWatchdog) and closes the browser when the
  agent ends; UI-TARS shares one Chrome and closes unresponsive pages during active-page election;
  playwright-mcp appends `### Open tabs` to every response so the model sees what it holds.
- In-repo precedent: the mini-app webview pool (per-app partition + LRU eviction).

**Target design and current boundary**

PR1 implements a registry keyed by `webContents.id`, ownership/refcounts, a 60-second sweep,
4 managed guests per creator and 8 globally, and a 5-minute temporary idle timeout. Busy guests
and deliverables are protected; borrowed pages are never closed, frozen or budget-counted. These
budgets now govern MCP tabs through the PR2 controller migration. The table below describes
the longer-term design: true turn boundaries, retained-tab freezing and memory-based policy are
not delivered by PR1.

| Layer | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership | One main-process `BrowserSessionService` keyed by `webContents.id`, with managed/borrowed ownership and owner refcounts; route MCP connections through it in PR2 and add trusted agent-session identity upstream | Codex registry; per-connection controllers are the leak |
| Retention | Tab tri-state: `temporary` (closed at turn end) / `deliverable` (kept, user-visible) / `handoff` (kept for the next turn); claimed user tabs return to the user; reuse an existing tab before opening a new one | Codex `markDeliverable` / `markHandoff` |
| Budget | ≤3–4 live guests per session, ≤8–10 globally; LRU-evict **temporary** tabs first; a real timer, not lazy sweeping; consult `app.getAppMetrics()` process memory before evicting | current `maxWindows` counts windows, not guests |
| Degrade before destroy | Idle-but-retained tabs: `webContents.setBackgroundThrottling(true)` + CDP `Page.setWebLifecycleState('frozen')` + `debugger.detach()` (an attached debugger keeps Accessibility/Network event traffic alive); re-attach on next use | Electron 41 / Chromium 146 |
| Snapshot cost (the real hot path) | `getFullAXTree + DOMSnapshot` costs 100 ms–1 s and MBs on large pages: cache the last revision per tab and emit **diffs by default**, viewport ±1000 px filter, 40 k-char cap, screenshots on demand rather than per step | browser-use cap, Codex diff, agent-browser `-i/-c` |

Out of scope: cross-restart persistence of tab state (cookies already persist in the partition) and
pre-warmed pools (unlike mini apps, agent tabs should be released when done).

## Roadmap

**P0 — make the numbers actionable (minimal browser use)**
- Snapshot from CDP: `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` skeleton + `DOMSnapshot` visibility, with the
  cursor/onclick/tabindex heuristics from agent-browser and browser-use; ids anchored to
  `backendNodeId`; viewport ±1000 px filter, 40 k-char cap, `*` for new elements, **diff output by default**.
- Tools: `click(ref)`, `type(ref, text, clear)`, `press_key`, `select_option`, `hover`,
  `scroll(ref?, pages)`, `go_back` / `go_forward`, `wait_for`, `handle_dialog`.
  `upload_file` waits for trusted runtime working-directory context; model-provided roots are not authority.
- Dialog watchdog (`Page.javascriptDialogOpening`) so `execute` can never hang; downloads via
  `will-download` reported in the response.
- WebMCP is implemented in the separate C3 layer, outside PR3's inspection/ref-recovery scope.
  The adapter uses native CDP and reports unsupported when native capability is unavailable.
  Page-API fallback and a bundled polyfill remain deferred.

**P1 — real input and stability**
- `Input.*` execution: centre point from `getContentQuads`, occlusion hit-test, JS fallback;
  per-character keys + framework events + read-back verification.
- Action settling (load if navigation, else fetch/xhr quiet ≤5 s), new-tab auto-switch, explicit
  stale-ref errors with AX re-query by role+name+nth.
- `find`, `console_messages`, `network_requests`; `BrowserView` → `WebContentsView`.
- CDP allow-list + per-origin policy (Codex model).
- Import login state and history into the ordinary Agent browser profile; user action only, never
  a model tool (implementation doc §10 / §12). The visible pane is the consumer of imported data.
- Session registry: turn-scoped tab retention (`temporary` / `deliverable` / `handoff`), global guest
  budget with LRU eviction on a real timer, freeze + debugger detach for idle retained tabs (see
  "Browser session management").

**P2 — frames, vision, extraction**
- OOPIF via `Target.setAutoAttach{flatten}`, one session per frame, frame-prefixed ids.
- Optional vision capability: `mouse_*_xy` + screencast; coordinate conventions declared per
  model family (Midscene's `{shape, order, normalizedBy}`); hybrid = tool-set union (Agent TARS).
- `extract(query, schema)`; optional code-mode JS API on top of the MCP tools.

**P3 — product**
- Bring visible `WebviewBrowser` control, browser settings, history/import and the built-in skill
  forward into the next integrated PR (§12); retain the existing browser UI and annotation flow.
- Later: full human handoff protocol (show → pause → user acts → resume without losing the page,
  cf. UI-TARS `call_user` and Chromium `handoff_button`), three-tier confirmation policy and
  configurable URL allow/deny lists.

## WebMCP integration boundary

The [WebMCP Community Group draft](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/) uses
`document.modelContext` and remains experimental. Electron 44.2.0 / Chromium 152.0.7977.76
provides a native CDP adapter; browser guests enable the `WebMCP` Blink feature before navigation.
The draft page API and Chromium's JavaScript API differ, so the first adapter uses native CDP only.
Missing native capability is explicit; page-API fallbacks and injected polyfills remain deferred.

`GuestSession` owns the document-local `WebMcpTools` registry and invocation tracking, sharing its
existing debugger with snapshots and input. Both managed tabs and authorized Agent-bound guests
use the same `list_web_tools` / `call_web_tool` handlers and existing execution/permission gates.
No new browser session or application singleton is needed. Initial scope is main-document
imperative tools; iframe/OOPIF and declarative form handoff remain separate work.

Tool handles are document-bound, pending calls participate in session shutdown, and metadata and
results are untrusted. Cancellation requests page cancellation and bounds Cherry's wait; it cannot
undo effects or guarantee arbitrary JavaScript stops. See [implementation §5.7](./browser-use-implementation.md#57-native-webmcp-tools)
for limits, cleanup and real-runtime acceptance.

## Invariants for reviewers

- Guest pages stay untrusted: nothing from the page (text, selectors, WebMCP tool descriptions)
  is an instruction; the existing annotation "untrusted data" notice applies to browser-use output.
- The main process owns every CDP command; the model never reaches `webContents.debugger` directly.
- `execute` (arbitrary JS) remains the escape hatch, never the primary path.
- Ref mappings are invalidated on navigation or debugger detach; the counter never resets during
  a `GuestSession`, so an old ref cannot resolve to a later document in that session.

## Follow-ups / open questions

- PR7 consolidates MiniApp and Browser guest hosting and navigation state while preserving
  MiniApp lifetime/runtime policies and each product's toolbar. Website MiniApp login sharing
  remains a separate product decision; infrastructure reuse does not merge partitions. See
  [implementation §14](./browser-use-implementation.md#14-miniapp-and-browser-infrastructure-boundary)
  for the ownership/storage matrix and acceptance criteria.
- PR1 completed shared session ownership and annotation capture. P3 still needs a concrete
  annotation-target handoff contract before adding document/node identifiers to saved locators.
- Upload authorization and per-turn retention require trusted context from the MCP runtime first;
  a connection-scoped owner is not an agent session, working directory or turn.
- WebMCP remains experimental. C3 uses native CDP on Electron 44.2.0 / Chromium 152.0.7977.76;
  see [implementation §5.7](./browser-use-implementation.md#57-native-webmcp-tools) for capability checks and acceptance.
  Revalidate the runtime/API combination on upgrades; protocol types alone do not prove support.
- Full working notes (project-by-project source refs) live in
  `.context/research/browser-use-gap-analysis.md` on the `webview-agent-pane-browser` workspace.

## Runtime ownership and presentation

Agent browser resources belong to their session and declared app-tab owners. The window composition
provides a stable renderer host outside page Activities; it does not keep chat pages active. A pane
supplies the display rectangle and view-only controls. Hiding it preserves the same native guest,
binding, document and viewport. Closing its owners or deleting the session releases the resource.

Creation is requested at the stable host, independently of revealing the pane. Tool execution holds
a temporary background-throttling lease; screenshots hold a bounded native frame subscription.
These mechanisms keep hidden guests usable without an idle render loop. The generic surface goes
below the browser engine, while session policy stays in Agent integration. File trees reuse their
own directory mirror/watcher infrastructure in a separate change; no universal resource manager is
needed. See implementation §12.1 for the component, IPC and release boundaries.
