/**
 * Single owner of the painting generation request: `validate -> materialize ->
 * generate`, plus the re-entrancy guard, cancel, and the state the UI reads.
 *
 * **Materialization is part of the request, not a step before it.** It is injected
 * as a capability rather than passed as data because the draft attachments live in
 * the composer's tool context, below this hook in the tree — so the owner decides
 * *when* inputs are resolved while their holder only supplies *how*. Doing it the
 * other way round (composer materializes, then calls in) put irreversible side
 * effects ahead of a check that could have refused the request for free: a guard
 * failure would strand freshly-created `delete_when_unreferenced` entries that no
 * painting ref ever claims.
 *
 * Two gates, deliberately at different points:
 * - `validateBeforeGenerate` asks whether a request is possible at all
 *   (provider enabled, model present and resolvable). Cheap and side-effect free,
 *   so it runs before anything is created.
 * - the `complete` flag asks whether the request's inputs fully resolved. It can
 *   only be answered after materialization, and aborts before the paid call.
 *
 * State: `submitting` is this hook's own — one user-initiated request in flight.
 * `generating` is *not*; it is derived from `painting.generationStatus` and can be
 * set by a run this component never started (a resumed generation rehydrates it
 * from the cache mirror). Both compose into the guard, and both are forwarded so
 * the UI can disable a send without owning either.
 *
 * `cancel(paintingId)` keeps the original signature so list-side flows
 * (e.g. cancel-before-delete) can target a specific painting.
