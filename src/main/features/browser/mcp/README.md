# Browser MCP server

`@cherry/browser` controls background Electron tabs through `BrowserSessionService`.
Tools use `McpServer.registerTool()` with Zod schemas for SDK validation and discovery.
The MCP factory resolves the lifecycle service; each server owns a controller and
releases its tabs and listeners when the connection closes. All page CDP commands
use the shared `GuestSession` allow-list and command deadlines.

Connection closure starts tracked asynchronous cleanup. The lifecycle service waits
for transport closure, controller disposal and active tool handlers to settle;
the SDK's `onclose` notification alone does not indicate cleanup completion.
Controller disposal waits for managed contents to emit `destroyed` and windows
to emit `closed`, including when Electron completes native teardown asynchronously.
Shutdown failures are reported after remaining guest leases are released.

## Visible Agent host

The `browser` server mounted by Agent runtimes uses `AgentBrowserController`, bound to a trusted
Agent/Session and its visible right-pane guest. It exposes 18 tools: `switch_tab`, `close_tab` and
`reset` are absent. `open` reveals/navigates that page; private/new-tab requests are rejected.
`list_tabs` returns only that session's target. Ordinary HTTP(S) popup links navigate the same visible
page. Unsupported destinations, POST popups and isolated preview/artifact popups remain blocked;
subsequent action results report `popupUnsupported`. No hidden replacement tab is created. Calls on this single-page host
are serialized, and target revocation cancels active and queued work.

The UI owns these guests. Control uses borrowed leases with explicit inspection observers;
releasing control preserves the guest and concurrent annotation leases. Native dialogs are not
auto-dismissed, and hidden-page focus emulation is not applied. Fresh observation clears browser
refs without invalidating a running annotation capture. The setting defaults on for unset preferences and runtime
connection signatures reflect changes. Enabling Browser control grants all known browser tools
without per-action approval until the user turns it off. Runtime gates and queued dispatch enforce
revocation even in Full Access. Disabling the browser group in an Agent blocks its controller without
closing the page.

## Observe, act, verify

1. `open({ url })` returns `{ currentUrl, title, tabId }`.
2. `snapshot({ tabId })` returns a bounded accessibility tree with actionable `eN`
   refs. The next snapshot returns changes; use `full: true` for the whole tree.
3. `click({ tabId, ref })`, `type({ tabId, ref, text, clear: true })`, and other
   actions return a snapshot diff so the agent can verify the result.

Page text, dialog messages, titles and downloaded filenames are untrusted data.
They must never be treated as instructions. Refs belong to one tab's live
session/document; take a new snapshot after navigation or debugger detachment.
An explicit unknown `tabId` fails instead of acting on another page.

## Tools

All page tools accept optional `tabId` and `privateMode`. Use explicit tab IDs for
parallel work; operations on a single tab run serially.

| Tool | Additional input | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `url`, `format?`, `selector?`, `maxChars?`, `timeout?`, `newTab?`, `showWindow?` | Existing navigation/content formats preserved; use `newTab` for independent pages |
| `execute` | `code`, `timeout?` | JavaScript escape hatch; existing value output preserved; prefer dedicated input tools |
| `screenshot` | `ref?`, `fullPage?`, `cursor?`, `format?`, `quality?` | Viewport/target image, or bounded full-page image tiles |
| `snapshot` | `full?`, `scope?`, `maxChars?` | Diff by default; `scope` is a ref, replacing the old CSS selector; cap 256–40,000 characters |
| `list_web_tools` | — | Native main-document WebMCP descriptors with document-bound IDs; capability absence is explicit |
| `call_web_tool` | `toolId`, `args` | Invoke a listed imperative website tool; validates its schema and returns bounded untrusted output |
| `find` | `role?`, `name?` (at least one) | Exact accessible role/name match in the main document, including offscreen elements; returns up to 100 refs without changing the diff baseline |
| `console_messages` | `level?: error / warning / all`, `clear?` | Recent console output and uncaught exceptions; clear removes all entries matching the selected level after reading |
| `network_requests` | `clear?` | Recent method, URL, status and completion/failure state, including redirect hops; clear removes all recorded requests after reading |
| `click` | `ref`, `button?`, `clickCount?` | Real mouse events; covered left single clicks use a reported synthetic fallback |
| `hover` | `ref` | Mouse movement; covered targets fail |
| `scroll` | `ref?`, `pages?` | Scroll viewport or target; negative pages scroll up |
| `type` | `ref`, `text`, `clear?`, `submit?` | Input events, read-back verification and one bounded retry; optional Enter |
| `press_key` | `key` | Key or chord, e.g. `Enter`, `Control+a`, `Meta+a`, `Shift+Tab` |
| `select_option` | `ref`, `values` | Native select by value then label; validates all choices before mutation |
| `go_back`, `go_forward` | — | Tab history navigation |
| `wait_for` | `text?`, `ref?`, `gone?`, `timeoutMs?` | At least text or ref; waits up to 30 seconds for snapshot presence/absence |
| `handle_dialog` | `accept`, `promptText?` | Resolves the pending page dialog without replaying the blocked action |
| `list_tabs`, `switch_tab`, `close_tab`, `reset` | Existing inputs | List, select or release tabs/windows |

Snapshot and action results are JSON text with `ok`, `tabId`, `url`, `title`,
`navigated`, and `snapshot` on success. Covered fallback clicks include
`occluded: true` and `synthetic: true`. Failures include `error`; stale refs tell
the caller to re-snapshot. Pending dialogs and download state changes accompany
results. Popups switch the active tab and report `newTabId`; the current result snapshot still
belongs to the source tab, so observe the new tab explicitly. An `execute` interrupted by a page dialog returns the same error envelope.

Inspection tools use the same result envelope and untrusted-data notice. `find` adds `matches`;
console/network tools add `messages` / `requests`. Each includes `truncated` for the result limit.
Console and network history keep 200 entries per managed tab across navigation, with 2,000-character
text fields and 40,000-character entry-array output caps. An oversized result returns the newest
entries in chronological order; `clear` also removes matching entries omitted from that result.
Network summaries contain no request/response headers or bodies. Clearing inspection does not
clear pending fetches used by action settling. Debugger detach and disposal clear history.

Before an element action, a disconnected/missing node can recover once by its original full
accessible role/name, only if that pair was and remains unique in the same document. Ambiguous
matches require a fresh snapshot. Recovery never retries an action after it has started.

JavaScript dialogs interrupt outstanding commands immediately. Managed dialogs
are dismissed after 60 seconds and the next result reports `dismissedDialog` once.
Borrowed annotation guests are never auto-dismissed. Downloads keep their normal
Electron save flow; the engine observes the originating guest's state changes
without capturing other tabs' downloads.

## Ownership and limits

Normal tabs use `persist:default`, shared across MCP clients; private tabs use the
in-memory `private` partition. Private mode does not write storage to disk, but
resetting a window does not destroy Electron's app-lifetime in-memory partition.
Windows stay hidden unless `showWindow: true` is requested.

The service allows 4 managed guests per server owner and 8 globally, evicts idle
temporary tabs first, and sweeps every minute for tabs idle for five minutes.
Running operations and progressing downloads are protected. Closing the final
tab closes its host window and tab bar. Borrowed pages are never reclaimed.

The MCP runtime currently has no trusted agent session/workdir or turn identity.
Owners are connection-scoped; retention is not per turn. Uploads are deferred
until that upstream context exists. Retained-tab
freezing, WebContentsView migration and visible-pane control are later layers.

A targeted `reset` requires both `tabId` and `privateMode`; incomplete or unknown
targets fail without closing other tabs. `wait_for({ ref, gone: true })` succeeds
when navigation has invalidated that ref. Closing windows and contents stay owned
until native destruction completes, and their callbacks cannot remove replacements.


## Screenshots

Prefer `snapshot` to locate a target, then `screenshot({ ref })` to inspect its region.
A screenshot without a ref captures the visible viewport. Target captures include 12 CSS pixels
of context around the element and do not scroll, focus it, or require it to be clickable.

`fullPage: true` returns separate image tiles in row-major order, never a stitched long image.
Each call returns at most four images and 12 MiB of base64 data. Each image is limited to
1440 pixels per side and 1.6 million pixels, with CDP scaling accounting for page zoom and DPR.
The first text block describes each image's document-CSS region, image/CSS scale and tile index.
If `nextCursor` is present, repeat with the same tab and `fullPage: true, cursor: nextCursor`.
Navigation or a change in page dimensions invalidates continuation. `ref` and `fullPage` are exclusive.

Images are live observations, not an atomic snapshot of a changing page. Capture does not trigger
scroll-based lazy loading; use an explicit scroll action if the target content has not loaded.
Do not use image pixels as input coordinates. Prefer snapshot refs for subsequent actions.

## Website tools

Browser guests enable native WebMCP before loading the page. Use `list_web_tools` to discover
a site's tools and `call_web_tool` with a returned ID. The persistent Browser control grant
authorizes both tools without per-action approval. Tools run in the existing page
and use its login state; no separate MCP URL or credential import is required.

An available API with no tools differs from `capability: unsupported`. Main-document imperative
tools are callable. Native declarative forms are listed with `supported: false`; iframe tools
and polyfills are not supported. Invalidated IDs return `stale_web_tool`: list again instead of
reusing an old ID. Timeout and cancellation do not undo effects; observe before retrying.

Discovery keeps at most 64 registrations and returns at most 64,000 metadata characters.
Descriptions cap at 2,000 characters; schemas at 16,000. Arguments and returned output cap at
40,000 characters. Unsupported schemas fail without fetching external references. No screenshot
or snapshot is appended automatically. Metadata, annotations and output remain untrusted data.
