/**
 * What each built-in Agent is allowed to reach — declared by the Agent, read by the runtimes.

 * Before this table the same statements ("Cherry Support is closed to its own bundle", "Cherry
 * Assistant has host privileges when local") were re-derived as `builtin_role ===` branches in each
 * runtime, and had already drifted apart. A runtime must not ask which Agent this is; it reads a
 * capability.
 *
 * Declared in TypeScript rather than the bundled `agent.json`: these grant host-level privileges,
 * and keeping them in the type system means a new built-in Agent cannot widen its own reach through
 * a data file. `agent.json` stays the Agent's content (identity, instructions, skills).
