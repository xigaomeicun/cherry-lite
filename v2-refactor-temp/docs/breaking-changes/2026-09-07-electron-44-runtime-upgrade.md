## What changed

The app now runs on Electron 44 (Chromium 152) instead of Electron 41 (Chromium 146). **macOS 12 (Monterey) is no longer supported** — the packaged app declares macOS 13 (Ventura) as its minimum and will not launch below it. Two runtime defaults also changed: file pickers that do not request a specific folder now open in Downloads instead of the last folder browsed, and frameless windows on Linux now have rounded corners unless they explicitly opt out.

## Why this matters to the user

A user still on macOS 12 cannot run this version at all — macOS refuses to launch the app rather than showing an in-app message, so the failure looks like the app is broken. Everyone else notices the file-picker change: adding an attachment or choosing a knowledge base folder starts in Downloads every time rather than returning to wherever they last browsed. Save and export dialogs are unaffected — every one of them already passes a suggested filename, so Electron leaves their starting folder alone. On Linux, window corners are rounded where they used to be square.

## What the user should do

macOS 12 users must upgrade to macOS 13 or later to keep receiving updates; the last release supporting Monterey remains installable. Everyone else: nothing — automatic.

## Notes for release manager

The macOS 12 drop is the item that needs to be prominent in the release note and ideally announced ahead of the release — it is the only change here a user cannot work around inside the app.

The Downloads default comes from Electron itself, not from a Cherry Studio setting, so there is no toggle to offer. If users complain, the fix is to track the last-used directory per dialog in the app — worth deciding before release rather than after.

Three further runtime changes are deliberately not listed above because they do not affect users of official builds: macOS notifications now require a code-signed app (signed release builds are unaffected; only unsigned local dev builds lose notifications), Electron dropped Unity desktop integration on Linux (we never called the removed API), and Electron stopped publishing 32-bit Windows and ARMv7 Linux binaries (we already ship only 64-bit).
